# 6. Jest

Date: 2019-11-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to find a way to test the JWT roles are working.

## Decision

We will use Jest to snapshot test the react website and mock the roles for that purpose.

## Consequences

Jest snapshot tests are easy to setup and use but Jest doesn't like any styling of any kind, so we will have to use babel as well to mock styling. We may also need webpack if we start using more dynamic styling.
