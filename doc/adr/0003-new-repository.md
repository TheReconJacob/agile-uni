# 3. New repository

Date: 2019-10-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There is an old repository on Gitlab created by the apprentices a couple of years ago. We may wish to build on this or start again from scratch.

## Decision

We will start a new repository on Github and may pull some bits from the existing Gitlab repository if and when we need them.

## Consequences

We will have to initialise a whole new application and set up git rules for it. We won't need to worry about functionality of an existing codebase.
