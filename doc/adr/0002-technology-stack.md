# 2. Technology stack

Date: 2019-10-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide which technologies to build our project in before we get to work on building. There is an existing project on gitlab.

## Decision

- Frontend: ReactJS with Sky CSS toolkit  
- Backend: NodeJS  
- Database: MySQL in docker  
- Security: Azure AD  
- Version control: Github  
- Functional testing: Cucumber/Selenium  
- Unit testing: Mocha

## Consequences

We may have to learn some of these technologies from scratch so will schedule in spike time if needed.
