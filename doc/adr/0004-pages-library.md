# 4. Pages library

Date: 2019-11-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Sky has a pages library with JSX components available for use.

## Decision

We will use the pages library to implement Sky styled components.

## Consequences

We won't have to hard code our own components, or learn bootstrap. We do need to get an npm registry auth token, and will have to learn how to implement the JSX components.
